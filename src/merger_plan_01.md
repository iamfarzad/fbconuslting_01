Here is a detailed summary and explanation of the merger_plan_01.md:

⸻

📦 merger_plan_01.md – Fullstack Project Merger Plan

This plan outlines the unification of four separate projects into a single modern consulting + AI education portfolio, using Next.js 14 App Router as the foundation.

⸻

✅ Primary Goal

Create one unified, maintainable project by merging:
	•	🧩 Clean design and component structure (from fbconsulting)
	•	🧠 AI chat backend with Gemini (from fbcounsulting_v2)
	•	📘 Educational AI course content (from personal-ai-builder-main)
	•	📚 Research literature explorer (from industry-ai-education)

⸻

🔍 Project Roles

1. fbconsulting → Design & UI Foundation
	•	URL: https://github.com/iamfarzad/fbconsulting
	•	✅ Use as the main base
	•	✅ Keep all styles (Tailwind, custom classes)
	•	✅ Keep well-organized components (hero/, layout/, chat/, ui/)
	•	✅ Keep App Router pages /about, /contact, /faq, etc.

Exclude: /api/, /backend/, legacy Python or AI testing code

⸻

2. fbcounsulting_v2 → Chat/Voice Gemini Backend Only
	•	✅ Keep only:
	•	/app/api/chat/*: Gemini voice + chat endpoints
	•	/lib/: any util files used in chat
	•	/types/: if referenced
	•	/hooks/: only if used in backend logic
	•	package.json: extract backend-only deps

Exclude: all frontend pages, components, styles

⸻

3. personal-ai-builder-main → Course UI & Steps Content
	•	✅ Extract:
	•	Hero.tsx, Header.tsx, Footer.tsx → integrate with /components/
	•	StepCard.tsx, LevelSection.tsx, etc. → /components/courses/
	•	data/*, types/* → /data/, /types/
	•	Tailwind config → merge manually

Exclude: SPA entry files (index.html, main.tsx), Vite configs

⸻

4. industry-ai-education → Resources & Literature Explorer
	•	✅ Extract:
	•	/app/resources/literature/[category]/[id]/page.tsx
	•	components/literature/ → /components/resources/
	•	data/literature-data.ts
	•	types/, lib/utils.ts → if used in UI

✅ Here are the essential files and folders we want to extract and preserve from fbconsulting as the design + layout + UI foundation:

⸻

✅ Must Keep from fbconsulting

1. Design System (Tailwind, styles)
	•	src/styles/* → Custom styles (glassmorphism, layout, text styles, animations)
	•	tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js
	•	globals.css (merged, if not duplicated)

2. UI Components

From: src/components/
	•	hero/ → HeroSection, HeroContent, HeroBackground, etc.
	•	ui/ → Buttons, Card, Typography, Container, Accordion, ChatBubble, etc.
	•	layout/ → Header, Footer, Navbar, ThemeToggle, Sidebar
	•	testimonials/ → EnhancedTestimonialCard, Testimonials
	•	chat/ → Chat UI (keep frontend only)
	•	icons/ → Custom icons if used (e.g. Logo, Lucide wrappers)
	•	PopoverMenu.tsx, MobileNavbar.tsx, etc.

3. Pages Structure (App Router)

From: src/app/
	•	page.tsx → Landing page
	•	about/, contact/, faq/, services/, testimonials/, pricing/ → Keep folder + page.tsx files

4. Assets
	•	public/ → Images, favicons, branding assets

5. Chat UX Frontend Only (Not logic)
	•	Any GeminiCopilot UI from chat/, CopilotProvider, UnifiedVoiceUI → keep layout/UI only for now

6. Documentation / Planning (optional for traceability)
	•	README.md
	•	IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md, PHASE_2_PLAN.md
	•	CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md (to document the merge)

⸻

❌ Do Not Include
	•	AiDE-main/, backend/, api/ → legacy/experimental
	•	.context/, .idx/, .windsurfrules → unused project-scoped metadata
	•	Legacy/duplicated .py, .ipynb, or Copilot test files

⸻

✅ Based on fbcounsulting_v2, here are the only key files/folders to extract and merge — since we’re keeping only the working Gemini chat backend:

⸻

✅ From fbcounsulting_v2: Extract Only These

1. app/api/ – Gemini Chat API Routes
	•	✅ Keep the full structure and logic for Google Gemini Chat/Voice backend.
	•	Includes multimodal chat endpoints.

Path:

/app/api/chat/...



⸻

2. lib/ – Utility Functions
	•	✅ Only if used by the chat API route (e.g., config, middleware, fetchers).

Path:

/lib/*



⸻

3. types/ – Shared Types (if referenced by backend)
	•	✅ Migrate only types referenced in chat backend files.

Path:

/types/*



⸻

4. hooks/ – Custom hooks (optional)
	•	Only if chat API logic references a hook like useChat, etc.

⸻

5. package.json – Dependencies
	•	✅ Extract only backend-related dependencies, e.g.:
	•	@google/generative-ai
	•	openai, etc.

⸻

🛑 DO NOT import:
	•	Any frontend components (components/, app/ pages)
	•	Styling, layouts, design logic
	•	Public assets

⸻

✅ Here’s what we found in personal-ai-builder-main:

⸻

📦 Root Metadata:
	•	tailwind.config.ts, postcss.config.js, vite.config.ts → Vite + Tailwind setup
	•	package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.
	•	index.html, main.tsx → Vite SPA entry

⸻

📁 Relevant Extractable Files for Educational Course Pages:

1. Components

Located in src/components/:
	•	Hero.tsx
	•	Header.tsx, Footer.tsx
	•	CallToAction.tsx, LevelSection.tsx, StepCard.tsx
	•	/advanced/, /intermediate/, /basic/ → AI course steps

These define the reusable UI + layouts for AI learning flows.

2. Layout

src/layout/ → Likely wrapper shell or layout components (to be inspected).

3. Pages

src/pages/ (Vite/SPA based) — May need to be rewritten for Next.js App Router format.

4. Data/Types
	•	src/data/ → Step and section content
	•	src/types/ → TypeScript interfaces for steps, lessons

5. UI Components
	•	src/components/ui/ → Buttons, cards, layout elements

⸻

✅ Files to Extract & Adapt:

Source	Destination
src/components/Hero.tsx → /components/hero/HeroSection.tsx	
src/components/Footer.tsx → /components/layout/Footer.tsx	
src/components/Header.tsx → /components/layout/Header.tsx	
src/components/StepCard.tsx, etc. → /components/courses/	
src/data/* → /data/	
src/types/* → /types/	
Tailwind config → merged with existing config	



✅ From industry-ai-education (Resources)

Category	Destination
app/resources/literature	/app/resources/literature/[category]/[id]/page.tsx
components/literature/	/components/resources/
data/literature-data.ts	/data/
lib/utils.ts	if used
types/	merge into /types/
