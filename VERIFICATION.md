# Verification System

This project includes a comprehensive verification system to ensure code quality and proper integration of all components. The system consists of several specialized scripts that work together to validate different aspects of the codebase.

## Available Scripts

### 1. Complete Verification
```bash
./scripts/verify_all.sh
```
Runs all verification checks in sequence:
- TypeScript fixes and checks
- Merge implementation verification
- Localization system checks
- UI component verification
- Build check

### 2. TypeScript Fixes
```bash
./scripts/fix_typescript.sh
```
- Installs missing TypeScript dependencies
- Creates and updates type definitions
- Updates import paths
- Runs TypeScript compiler checks

### 3. Merge Verification
```bash
./scripts/verify_merge.sh
```
Checks for the presence of required components from:
- fbconsulting (UI components)
- fbconsulting_v2 (Chat backend)
- personal-ai-builder-main (Workshop system)
- industry-ai-education (Literature explorer)

### 4. Component Verification
```bash
./scripts/verify_components.sh
```
Validates UI components against requirements:
- Type definitions
- Props interface
- Component structure

## Status Reports

Verification results are logged to `src/LOCALIZATION_STATUS.md` (Note: filename might need update for clarity) with timestamps. This file provides a historical record of verification runs and their outcomes.

## Adding New Checks

To add new verification checks:
1. Create a new script in the `scripts/` directory
2. Add the check to `scripts/verify_all.sh`
3. Update this documentation
4. Update the status reporting in `src/LOCALIZATION_STATUS.md`

## Best Practices

1. Run the complete verification before:
   - Making a pull request
   - Deploying to production
   - Merging major features

2. Fix TypeScript issues immediately when detected

3. Document any new components in the relevant verification scripts
