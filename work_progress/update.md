## [Agent 1 - 2025-04-04]
- Fixed ServiceItem import and typing in servicesData.tsx
## Phase: Code Quality Improvements & Type Fixing (Completed)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Focused on resolving TypeScript errors identified by `npx tsc --noEmit` and subsequent runtime errors encountered during testing.

**Details:**
*   Ran initial `npx tsc --noEmit` check, revealing 11 errors across 7 files.
*   **Fixed TypeScript Errors (9/11):**
    *   `src/components/hero/HeroChat.tsx`: Corrected usage of `GeminiAdapter`.
    *   `src/components/NewsletterSignup.tsx`: Fixed analytics event value type and added global type for `window.gtag`.
    *   `src/components/services/ServicesHero.tsx`: Removed invalid `variant` prop from `LanguageSwitcher`.
    *   `src/components/ui/ai-chat.tsx`: Refactored component to correctly render `Chat` within layout wrappers.
    *   `src/components/ui/chat-bubble/index.ts`: Corrected re-export statement.
    *   `src/components/ui/ConnectionStatusIndicator.tsx`: Added temporary interface for missing props type.
*   **Fixed Runtime Errors:**
    *   Resolved `TypeError: (0 react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__.createContext) is not a function` by adding `"use client"` directives to `Testimonials.tsx` and `SkillsTechnologies.tsx`.
    *   Resolved `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')` related to `@react-three/fiber` by:
        *   Adding `"use client"` directives to `Logo3D.tsx`, `DesktopNavbar.tsx`, `MobileNavbar.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, and `shadcnblocks-navbar-demo.tsx`.
        *   Temporarily replacing the `Logo3D` component with a placeholder in `DesktopNavbar.tsx` and `MobileNavbar.tsx` as the error persisted.
    *   Resolved duplicate navbar issue by removing `<Navbar />` from `src/app/about/page.tsx`.
    *   Updated the Gemini model name in `/api/chat/streaming/route.ts` from `gemini-pro` to `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` to fix the 404 API error.
*   **Remaining TypeScript Errors (2/11):**
    *   `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx`: Two persistent errors related to `ref` type mismatches. Suppressed with `@ts-ignore` / `as any` for now.
*   **Known Issues:**
    *   Chat functionality: While the API call returns 200, no response is displayed in the UI. Debugging deferred.
    *   `Logo3D` component: Temporarily replaced due to persistent SSR errors. Needs further investigation later.

## Phase: File Integration and Route Updates (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Copied core components, pages, and data files from `personal-ai-builder-main` and `industry-ai-education` into the main project structure as per `merger_plan_01.md`. Restructured routes to better reflect content purpose.

**Details:**

### Route Changes:
*   Renamed `/courses` route to `/workshop` to better reflect the interactive nature of the content
*   Updated navigation menu to include Workshop under Resources section
*   Updated page branding from "AI Builder Courses" to "AI Builder Workshop"
*   Fixed component naming consistency (CoursesPage â†’ WorkshopPage)

### File Integration:
*   **Created Directories:**
    *   `src/components/courses`
    *   `src/data`
    *   `src/app/resources/literature/[category]/[id]`
    *   `src/components/resources`
    *   `src/components/resources/literature`
*   **Copied from `personal-ai-builder-main`:**
    *   Data: `llmPlatformsData.ts`, `platformsData.ts` -> `src/data/`
    *   Components: `LevelSection.tsx`, `StepCard.tsx`, `StepsList.tsx` -> `src/components/courses/`
    *   Component Dirs: `advanced/`, `basic/`, `intermediate/` -> `src/components/courses/`
*   **Copied from `industry-ai-education`:**
    *   Data: `literature-data.ts` -> `src/data/`
    *   Components: `literature/` dir -> `src/components/resources/literature/`
    *   Page: `app/literature/[category]/[id]/page.tsx` -> `src/app/resources/literature/[category]/[id]/page.tsx` (Corrected path from plan)

**Next Steps (Based on merger_plan_01.md & User Feedback):**
*   Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors introduced by newly copied files.
*   Resolve import paths and potential conflicts in the copied files.
*   Integrate the copied components into the main application structure (e.g., create `/courses` and `/resources` pages/layouts).
*   Check and install any missing dependencies required by the new code.
*   Continue integrating UI components and content from `personal-ai-builder-main` (Course UI & Steps Content) and `industry-ai-education` (Resources & Literature Explorer) as per `merger_plan_01.md`.
*   Defer deep debugging of chat backend/frontend interaction until core UI structure is complete.
*   Address remaining TypeScript errors in `sidebar.tsx` if they cause issues. **(Completed 2025-04-03)**
*   Begin "Documentation" updates once major UI integration is done.

---

## Phase: Component Integration & Navigation (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Fixed remaining TypeScript errors, verified imports for integrated components, created main pages for Workshop and Literature sections, and updated header navigation.

**Details:**
*   **Fixed TypeScript Errors:** Resolved the two `ref` type mismatch errors in `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` by correcting `forwardRef` usage and types. Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` successfully.
*   **Verified Imports:** Checked imports in `src/components/courses/` and `src/components/resources/literature/`. Confirmed that `@/` aliases and relative paths are correct for the current project structure.
*   **Created Pages:**
    *   Created `src/app/workshop/page.tsx` using `LevelSection`, `StepsList`, and level-specific list components. Fixed `PageHeader` import and props.
    *   Created `src/app/resources/literature/page.tsx` using the `LiteraturePage` component.
*   **Updated Navigation:** Modified `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` to update navigation links: 'Courses' -> 'Workshop' (`/workshop`), 'Resources' -> `/resources/literature`.
*   **Dependency Check:** Confirmed `framer-motion` and `lucide-react` are present in `package.json`. No new dependencies needed for the integrated components so far.

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue integrating UI components and content from `personal-ai-builder-main` (Course UI & Steps Content) and `industry-ai-education` (Resources & Literature Explorer) as per `merger_plan_01.md`. Specifically, ensure the individual step pages for the workshop (`/workshop/[level]/[stepId]`) are set up correctly. **(Completed 2025-04-03)**
*   Integrate the "Insights" part of the resources section from `industry-ai-education`. **(Skipped - No specific 'insights' files found in source project)**
*   Defer deep debugging of chat backend/frontend interaction until core UI structure is complete.
*   Address the `Logo3D` component issue later.
*   Begin "Documentation" updates. **(Completed 2025-04-03)**

## Phase: Core Page Implementation (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Addressed user feedback regarding incomplete core page implementations. Analyzed original `fbconsulting` source structure (Vite/Pages Router) and adapted components for the current App Router structure. Verified core pages are using appropriate components.
---

## Phase: Homepage Hero Implementation (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Replaced the simplified `HeroSection.tsx` with the original modular structure from `fbconsulting`. Copied and adapted `HeroContent.tsx`, `HeroActions.tsx`, and `HeroBackground.tsx`.

**Details:**
*   Created new `src/components/hero/HeroSection.tsx` to orchestrate original components.
*   Copied `HeroContent.tsx`, `HeroActions.tsx`, `HeroBackground.tsx` from source (`/Users/farzad/windsurf_projects/fbconsulting/src/components/hero/`).
*   Adapted `HeroContent.tsx`:
    *   Replaced `useLanguage` with `useLocalization` hook.
    *   Removed invalid `variant` prop from `LanguageSwitcher`.
    *   Removed import and usage of missing `HeroVoiceInput.tsx`.
    *   Corrected component props interface and signature.
*   Adapted `HeroActions.tsx`:
    *   Replaced `react-router-dom`'s `useNavigate` with Next.js `<Link>`.
*   Verified dependencies (`LocationGreeting`, `analyticsService`, `ShimmerButton`, `AnimatedGridPattern`) exist in the current project.
*   **Missing Component:** `HeroVoiceInput.tsx` was imported by original `HeroContent.tsx` but not found in the source `hero` directory. Chat/voice input functionality is currently missing from the hero section.

**Next Steps:**
*   Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors.
*   Investigate the missing `HeroVoiceInput.tsx` or find an alternative implementation for chat/voice input in the hero section later.
*   Proceed with verifying other sections of the Homepage (`/app/page.tsx`).

---

## Phase: Services Page Structure Refactor (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Refactored the structure for the main Services page (`/app/services/page.tsx`) to use a proper container component instead of directly rendering the details list.

**Details:**
*   Identified that `/app/services/page.tsx` was incorrectly rendering `ServiceDetails.tsx` (which contained the list of all services).
*   Renamed `src/components/services/ServiceDetails.tsx` to `src/components/services/ServiceListSection.tsx` to better reflect its content.
*   Created a new container component `src/components/services/ServicesPageContainer.tsx`. This component imports and renders `ServicesHero` and `ServiceListSection`.
*   Updated `src/app/services/page.tsx` to import and render the new `ServicesPageContainer`.

**Next Steps:**
*   Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for type errors related to these changes.
*   Verify the implementation of `ServicesHero` and `ContactCTA` used within `ServicesPageContainer`.
*   Proceed with implementing individual service detail pages (e.g., `/services/automation`).
*   Address unrelated Jest test failures in `date.test.ts` and `chat.test.ts` later.

## Phase: FAQ Page Implementation (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Updated the FAQ page to use the standard Shadcn UI Accordion component instead of the previous placeholder implementation.

**Details:**
*   Verified that the original `fbconsulting` project did not contain a specific custom FAQ component.
*   Confirmed the standard Shadcn UI Accordion component (`src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`) exists in the current project.
*   Modified `src/app/faq/page.tsx` to import and use `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, and `AccordionContent` to display the `faqData`.

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue verifying page implementations (Services detail pages, etc.).
*   Address remaining design consistency tasks (visual verification, animation transitions).
*   Fix API integration issues.
*   Address content population tasks.

## [Agent 2 - 2025-04-04]
- Added desktop-specific padding (`lg:pt-24 lg:pb-24`) to `HeroSection.tsx` for better spacing.

---

## Phase: Homepage Implementation (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Verified and integrated core components for the Homepage (`/app/page.tsx`) based on the original `fbconsulting` structure.

**Details:**
*   **Hero Section:** Previously updated to use original components (`HeroSection`, `HeroContent`, `HeroActions`, `HeroBackground`). Missing `HeroVoiceInput.tsx` deferred.
*   **Features/Services Preview:**
    *   Replaced placeholder `src/components/sections/Features.tsx` with original `BentoGrid.tsx` from source.
    *   Copied dependencies: `BentoItem.tsx`, `servicesData.tsx`, and animation components (`ChatbotAnimation.tsx`, `ConsultationAnimation.tsx`, `CustomDevAnimation.tsx`, `DataInsightsAnimation.tsx`, `StrategyAnimation.tsx`, `WorkflowAnimation.tsx`) into appropriate directories (`src/components/bento/`, `src/data/`, `src/components/bento/animations/`).
    *   Added `ServiceItem` interface to `servicesData.tsx` and typed the `services` export.
    *   Fixed TypeScript errors in `BentoGrid.tsx` by importing and applying the `ServiceItem` type.
    *   Removed old `Features.tsx` file.
*   **Testimonials:**
    *   Verified `Testimonials.tsx` component structure matches the original.
    *   Copied original `testimonialsData.ts` to `src/data/`.
    *   Updated `Testimonials.tsx` to import data from `testimonialsData.ts` instead of using hardcoded data.
    *   Confirmed `Testimonial` type exists in `src/types/blog.ts`.
*   **CallToAction:**
    *   Verified that the current `src/components/sections/CallToAction.tsx` is suitable for the main homepage CTA, differing from the original `src/components/cta/ChooseAction.tsx` (which is likely part of the chat flow). No changes made.
*   **Page Structure:** Updated `/app/page.tsx` to use `BentoGrid` and removed placeholder/extraneous components (`Features`, `WhyWorkWithMe`, `SkillsTechnologies`).

**Next Steps:**
*   Verify styling and animations for the integrated homepage sections (`BentoGrid`, `Testimonials`, `CallToAction`) against the original design.
*   Address the missing `HeroVoiceInput.tsx` component later.
*   Proceed with implementing the next page according to the plan: About Page (`/app/about/page.tsx`). **(Completed verification, page seems OK)**
*   Address unrelated Jest test failures later.

---

## Phase: Design Consistency - Colors & Fonts (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Aligned colors and fonts in recently integrated components (`BentoGrid`, related animations) with the project's existing theme defined in `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.js`.

**Details:**
*   Identified missing color definitions (`retro-pink`, `deep-purple`) and font (`font-futuristic`) in `tailwind.config.js` required by copied components.
*   Decided to use existing theme variables instead of adding new ones for better consistency.
*   **Replacements Made:**
    *   `deep-purple` -> `secondary` (in `BentoGrid.tsx`)
    *   `retro-pink` -> `primary` (in `StrategyAnimation.tsx`, `DataInsightsAnimation.tsx`, `CustomDevAnimation.tsx`)
    *   `font-futuristic` -> Removed class (in `BentoGrid.tsx`)
    *   `teal` -> Kept as is (already defined in `tailwind.config.js`)
*   Verified `ServiceListSection.tsx` uses `teal`, which is defined.

**Next Steps:**
*   Continue verifying page implementations (Services detail pages, etc.).
*   Address remaining design consistency tasks (visual verification, animation transitions).
*   Fix API integration issues.
*   Address content population tasks.

---

## Phase: Design Consistency - Page Transitions (Ongoing)

**Date:** 2025-04-03

**Summary:** Implemented basic page transition animations using `framer-motion` in the root client layout.

**Details:**
*   Modified `src/components/ClientRootLayout.tsx`.
*   Imported `AnimatePresence`, `motion` from `framer-motion` and `usePathname` from `next/navigation`.
*   Wrapped `children` with `<AnimatePresence mode="wait">` and `<motion.div>`.
*   Used `pathname` as the key for `motion.div` to trigger animations on route changes.
*   Defined basic `pageVariants` (opacity fade) and `pageTransition` for the animation.

**Next Steps:**
*   Visually verify page transitions during navigation.
*   Refine animation variants (`pageVariants`, `pageTransition`) if needed.
*   Continue with other pending tasks (Service detail pages, API integration, etc.).
